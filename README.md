moparisthebest's helix config
-----------------------------

I use [Unix Programmer's Dvorak](https://github.com/moparisthebest/rusty-keys) for a keyboard layout, so when I started to learn helix,
I wanted to keep all the keys in the same position, but mapped to Dvorak.  There isn't even a default layout file for helix, so with
some awful bash and a tiny bit of manual editing I managed to:

1. extract default keymap from helix source code (config.orig.toml)
2. automatically convert it to dvorak (config.dvorak.toml)

I'll also keep my personal config.toml here, where I may make more tweaks.
